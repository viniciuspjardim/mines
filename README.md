# Mines

This project is [part of a blog post](https://www.viniciusjardim.com/posts/my-first-experience-with-zig-build-system) on how to build C projects with the Zig Build System.

After installing Zig you can build and run the project with:

```shell
# Build
zig build

# Run
./zig-out/bin/mines
```
